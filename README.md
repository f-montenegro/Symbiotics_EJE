# Credit Rating: Credit Metrics model application

This repository contains the python code referent to the tasks of Mission 2622 provided by EJE (ENSAE Junior Etudes) to the company Symbiotics.

This mission consisted of the development of a Credit Rating Stress Test method inspired by an open source model known as Credit Metrics, initially developed by the research team of JP Morgan.

I invite you to the Report of the Mission for further details about the mission and development of this python tool.
